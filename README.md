# Sleep-Cycle-Productivity-Data-Analysis
This notebook performed a comprehensive EDA on the Sleep Cycle & Productivity dataset.
Key observations include:
- Distributions of sleep hours and qualityâ€”revealing potential outliers (and maybe a few insomniacs).
- Interesting trends in sleep quality across different age groups and genders.
- Revealed relationships between exercise, caffeine intake, and sleep quality.
- Mapped common sleep and wake times along with possible day-of-week effects.
